# 📊 Week 4: E-commerce Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an **end-to-end data analysis and visualization workflow** on an e-commerce sales dataset. It covers data loading, cleaning, analysis, visualization using Matplotlib, and writing meaningful business insights.

The goal is to demonstrate how raw sales data can be transformed into **clear visual insights** that help understand performance trends.
