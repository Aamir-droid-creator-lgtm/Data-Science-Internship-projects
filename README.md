# 🎯 Student Grade Calculator

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Student Grade Calculator** is a beginner-friendly Python project designed to strengthen core programming concepts such as decision-making, loops, functions, and basic error handling. The program takes a student's name and marks as input, validates the data, calculates the grade based on predefined rules, and displays an encouraging message.

This project is suitable for **Python beginners**, **internship submissions**, and **academic evaluations**.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand and apply `if-elif-else` statements
* Use `while` loops for input validation
* Create and use functions effectively
* Handle invalid inputs safely using `try-except`
* Build a clean and well-structured Python project

## 🧠 Grading Logic

| Marks Range | Grade | Message                                |
| ----------- | ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| 90–100      | A     | Excellent work! 🌟                     |
| 80–89       | B     | Very Good! Keep it up! 👍              |
| 70–79       | C     | Good effort! You can do better 🙂      |
| 60–69       | D     | Needs improvement, don’t give up 💪    |
| 0–59        | F     | Keep trying, success takes practice 🌱 |

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Install **Python 3.x** on your system
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Open the project folder in **VS Code / Terminal**
4. Run the program using:

python grade_calculator.py

## 🧩 Program Explanation

* **Function Used**: `calculate_grade(marks)` determines grade and message
* **Conditional Logic**: Implemented using `if-elif-else`
* **Loop Used**: `while` loop ensures marks are between 0 and 100
* **Error Handling**: `try-except` prevents crashes on invalid input

## 🧪 Test Cases

Sample test cases are included in `test_cases.txt`:

Marks: 95 → Grade A
Marks: 83 → Grade B
Marks: 72 → Grade C
Marks: 61 → Grade D
Marks: 45 → Grade F
Marks: 110 → Invalid input
